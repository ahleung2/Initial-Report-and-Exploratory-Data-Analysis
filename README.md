### Predicting Breast Cancer Recurrence using Machine Learning

**Author**

#### Executive summary

#### Rationale
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women. Understanding the factors that contribute to its recurrence can significantly improve prognosis and survival rates. Furthermore, integrating predictive models into clincal practice allows healthcare providers to develop effective, targeted intervention in high risk patients.

#### Research Question
How can machine learning models be used to accurately predict the recurrence of breast cancer based on patient demographics, clinical and treatment-related features?

#### Data Sources
The dataset, sourced from UCI Machine Learning Repository, contains 9 attributes related to patient demographic, clinical characterisitcs and treatment as follows:
1. Class (Recurrence Event)
2. Age
3. Menopausal Stage
4. Tumor Size
5. Number of Lymph Nodes Involved
6. Presence of Extracapsular Extension
7. Degree of Malignancy
8. Breast (Left or Right)
9. Breat Quadrant
10. Irradiation

#### Methodology
Methods used comprise of the following:

_Data Exploration_
1. Get an Overview of the Dataset
2. Check for Missing Values
3. View Distribution of Each Feature
4. Visualize Data to Gain Insights to Data Distribution and Relationships

_Data Preprocessing_
1. Data Cleaning
2. Data Transformation (converting categorical features into numerical features)
3. Feature Scaling

_Exploration of Different Classifcation Models_
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. K-Nearest Neighbors
4. Support Vector Machines
5. Neural Networks (maybe)

_Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning_
1. Access performance of models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score
2. Perform hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
